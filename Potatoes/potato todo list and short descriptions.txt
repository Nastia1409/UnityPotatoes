The main idea is to have big potatoes have "followers" which are small potatoes that have their weapons/attacks etc and the big potato is the only controlable character/s.
For example you select one big potato and you order it to attack a different group or attack-move or something similar and whoever he focuses his group goes for 
(later we can maybe add a better action for it, for example just have the potato "order" his minions to protect him or be defensive and stay near or rush ahead as soon as target given, 
but idk how we will do it for now depending on our limitations.
the AI will have either many small potatoes and sometimes "bosses" which are big ones controlled by AI but acting exact same way as the human controlled ones.





Unit hierarchy (Unit->Character->Type) technically its possible to put all in the same script but i think it will be more managable and expandable if it will be cut this way

Unit - base unit scripts
	contains Default Values: HP(HealthPoits), AP(Action Points), HitboxScale, SpriteSize, DefaultSprite //add more here later
	contains Default Values: Selectable?, Selected?, CanMove?, ControllingPlayer (Player or AI?)
	contains path finding script
	contains default sprite for testing purposes that will be changed by child later to the apropriate one
	contains hitbox/colision box for clicks and stuff that can be edited by child to fit in size and needs etc

-Character - defines its a character that can be controlled by AI or human
	has a flag or whatever to check who this character belongs to (which player/ai) and then set the value which we got from parent and the activated the needed script? i dunno yet
	contains default AI script (the reason i want the AI script and controller be here so it will be easier to make same characters that can be controlled by either
	contains player controller script/hook(?) (a way to controll the character, select it etc)
	contains a value or type or whatever of which character is it, is it ground unit? maybe flying unit (maybe in the future? i dunno better keep it at least possible)
	also contains the value is it a follower character or a controlable character. Since i want big potatoes to be the controlable character sand the small ones do what the big one "tells them to do" it should be defined what type this is


--Type - defines what TYPE of character it is (unarmed, meele, ranged etc)
	has all the more appropriate moves for the character, for example if its a spear holding one, he will have his own set of moves and default hp values etc



/////////// todo
Setup Hierarchy (Unit->character->type)
Setup the proper values and functions to the scripts
make simple character which will be testdummy which will be "character" child
setup the default sprite for it for testing
Get path finding implemented
get animations working
work on ai (when we reach here ill add more tasks)

///////////// todo
get the sprites ready
get the animations ready
work more on the hierarchy and what values they need etc
